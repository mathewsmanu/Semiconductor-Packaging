# Semiconductor Packaging Simulation Labs

This repository provides ANSYS Electronics Desktop project files and documentation for semiconductor packaging labs. It is intended for academic or professional use in understanding and simulating thermal and mechanical aspects of advanced packaging technologies.

## 📘 Overview

The repository includes two simulation labs:

### 🔬 Lab 01: Thermal Analysis of Flip-Chip BGA

Focuses on thermal performance evaluation of a flip-chip Ball Grid Array (BGA) package.

**Key Steps:**

* Assigned realistic thermal boundary conditions
* Defined thermal monitors for die, underfill, and substrate
* Generated mesh optimized for thermal analysis
* Executed simulation under defined loading conditions
* Created temperature distribution plots for analysis

### 🧩 Lab 02: Package Design and Modeling

Covers the step-by-step physical modeling of a semiconductor package.

**Key Steps:**

* Designed die, die attach layer, and substrate
* Created bond pads on die and substrate
* Implemented wire bonding between pads
* Applied molding compound to encapsulate the package
* Assigned accurate material properties

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run and explore the simulations:

1. Launch **ANSYS Electronics Desktop** (version 202x or later recommended).
2. Open the corresponding `.aedt` file from the lab you wish to explore.
3. Use the **Project Manager** to view model geometry, setup, and results.
4. Modify or run new simulations as needed for exploration or research.

## 🛠️ Requirements
