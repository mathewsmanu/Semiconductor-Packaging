# Semiconductor Packaging Simulation Labs

This repository contains simulation files and documentation for semiconductor packaging labs using ANSYS tools.

## Labs Overview

### Lab 01: Thermal Analysis of Flip-Chip BGA

Focuses on thermal performance evaluation of a flip-chip Ball Grid Array (BGA) package.

**Key Steps:**

* Assigned realistic thermal boundary conditions
* Defined thermal monitors for die, underfill, and substrate
* Generated mesh optimized for thermal analysis
* Executed simulation under defined loading conditions
* Created temperature distribution plots for analysis

###  Lab 02: Package Design and Modeling

Covers the step-by-step physical modeling of a semiconductor package.

**Key Steps:**

* Designed die, die attach layer, and substrate
* Created bond pads on die and substrate
* Implemented wire bonding between pads
* Applied molding compound to encapsulate the package
* Assigned accurate material properties
